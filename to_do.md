To Do:


  + Move logo to navbar
  + Statistics page - Change style so it matches home page
  + After submit username, shows you which percentile you're in - OR at least give some indication that username was submitted okay. Maybe say "thanks for playing ${username}!"


  + ?? Should we add date_played to plays? This would be cool to show in the stats
