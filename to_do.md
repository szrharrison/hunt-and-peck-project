To Do:

  + Statistics page
     + Top 10 plays by WPM
     + search for username stats
     + Top 10 most accurate user
  + Show graph of wpm while typing
  + Highlight current word
  + Color the letters as you type them
  + Scroll paragraph as you get to end of second line
  + After submit username, shows you which percentile you're in

  + ?? Should we add date_played to plays? This would be cool to show in the stats
