p1 = "Pilots and passengers must wear heavy arctic clothing as few aircraft have cabin heat systems capable of coping
with the cold. Aircraft batteries are removed at the end of each day of flying to ensure maximum efficiency the next
day. Wings and engines are covered to stop the ingress of snow and the build up of frost on the flight surfaces.
Gasoline fueled blow-pots are often carried to provide engine preheat to ensure starting. The oil in these engines gets
so thick at minus to degrees that the engine cannot be turned. This writer has done chin-ups on the propeller of a
coldsoaked Cessna which flew the next day after preheating.The northern airports lack any degree of services in
comparison to those farther south. Fuel is usually available if you can locate the operator. Some of the larger
communities may have a pay telephone at the airstrip, but the normal procedure is to buzz the town on arrival. This lets
the people know you are landing and usually someone will head out to the strip to meet you.Unless you are a regular
customer, all transactions for fuel and oil are on a cash basis. Cheques are nearly useless in a village without a bank.
Credit to a stranger is foolhardy. During the grip of winter, the snowmobile is the major mode of transport in all but
the largest of settlements. In many places that do have roads in winter, vehicles are left running hours a day. If
allowed to get cold, it may take many hours of effort to restart balky engines."

p2 = "they'd managed about a mile on the highway, so instead of a mile closer, he was a mile further away. That was two
miles more than he had thought when he jumped from the truck. Make it four miles, then add another for bad luck and he
was easily a fool for going on. He ought to turn back, get in the truck and explain to Diana his idiocy. They could hold
each other and talk and joke the afternoon and night time away, lighting one candle from the stub of the last, keeping
each other warm under the scratchy wool of the army surplus blankets as they waited for the daylight and the end of the
storm; the inevitable snowplow followed by a Wyoming Highway Patrol car equipped with food and drink. Diana lit the
candle just like Dan told her to. She watched as he turned first one way, then the other. He hesitated, walked to the
left, hesitated again and she hoped he would turn around and come back to her but she knew he wouldn't. He had decided
to go to Casper for help and Dan always did what he set out to do. She held the candle in her hand as she watched the
back of his parka until it vanished with startling suddenness in the snow. She held the candle in her hand so that its
light shined through the window for a long time after she could see nothing but the snow racing ahead of the wind
because perhaps he could see it and know that she waited in trust for him to return."

p3 = "The drift trailed from the big airport sign. Had he not stumbled, he'd have gone right past, leaving another mile
before the next possible help.  His feet were no longer a part of him, the skin of his forehead rasped when he touched
it with his mittens and his legs felt both rubbery and wooden simultaneously. The road ran north a half mile to the
terminal with nothing but a few leafless and spindly trees planted to either side to break the wind.  It cut now from
his left front quarter.  He tucked his chin deeply into his right shoulder, wrapped his arms over his face, and slogged
on.  Perhaps a baby would complete the perfection of her. Their life had begun to seem too large, too loose. And they
sometimes rattled against each other like the last two hard dried kernels in a feed bucket. Maybe he was halfway to the
terminal. It might as well be halfway to the moon. He was exhausted, his breath dragged through the bandana in hard
gasps. He couldn't pull it down to breathe more freely. The bandana was stuck to his frozen nose and cheeks. Diana loved
kids, that was certain, and the kids at the School for the Deaf surely loved her.He grinned at that. Just last week,
Diana had been all bubbly excitement over the planning for next month's annual end school tour and picnic. As
teacher's aide, she would make sure that all the kids were dressed and equipped right for the ride to the Dave Johnson
power plant and the picnic and fishing in the little park"

p4 = "Buster Crab and Sam Clam were the best of friends for years, and every evening one could find Buster in Sam's bar
down by the beach. Finally,Buster passed on and went to heaven.  There, he was a model citizen, but he longed for the
companionship of his pal, Sam.  So the next Christmas, Buster was approached by God who asked him why he wasn't happy.
Buster explained that although heaven was a pretty nice place and the halo and wings were real swell, he missed Sam and
wished he could go back and spend just one more night in his bar by the beach.  God recalled how good Buster had been,
and told him that he could spend New Year's with Sam in his bar. However, God cautioned, things have changed since
you were there last. In order to keep up with the times, Sam has converted his place to a disco. Still, if you wish, you
may spend New Year's eve with your old buddy, but be sure not to drink and take good care of your wings, harp and halo.
Buster was ecstatic and spend the next week practicing his chops on the harp and polishing his halo. Then the big eveing
arrived and poof! there he was beside Sam in his disco. Well, they had a great time talking of old timesand dancing and
singing and playing. After a while, the temptation to have a drink proved too great for Buster, and he imbibed. So did
the rest of the party and the night got progressively wilder until morning found everyone sleeping it off on the
furniture and floors of the disco. His time up, Buster was transported poof! back to heaven. God saw him, bleary eyed,
halo dented and slipping off to one side, wings in disarray, and well, you get the picture.  God gives him an ice bag
and asks what happened. Buster! You've been at the bottle, haven't you?  Look at you wings! Look at that halo! And
where is you golden harp? To which Buster replies, I left my harp in Sam Clam's Disco."

p5 = "The air was filled with a combination of noxious odors that he  recognized but was unaccustomed to smelling on a
regular basis.  The offensive stench of urine from the alleyways, the odious scent of rotting garbage and filth that
overflowed the dumpsters and spilled into the street combined with the stale smell of alcohol and vomit to make his
stomach lurch.  Perhaps he was not as prepared for this as he had thought, but he was committed to this endeavor and
he'd follow through. He traveled down Franklin Street to the Hobo encampment that he'd been to earlier, beneath the
Harding overpass and told several people that he was searching for Rose Bellman. The first two men he'd asked were from
out of town, the next three people refused to even look at him and the woman he'd approached backed away from him in
fear. Discouraged, he sat down and leaned his back up against one of the overpass supports and placed in head in his
hands. Maybe Dana was right. maybe he couldn't be convincing enough to pull this off. Lying wasn't exactly his forte, in
fact she had told him more than once that he'd be terrible as an undercover agent for just that reason. Subterfuge
always went against his basic nature and the guilt he felt in its performance seemed to surface unconsciously in his
body language and expression. He sighed in frustration and anger at life's seeming unfairness at wasted lives needless
deaths his own inadequacies that he felt prevented him from solving this case. Lost in his thoughts, he failed to hear
the approaching footsteps that halted before him until the voice brought him back to reality."

p6 = "When I look at the three massive manuscript volumes which contain our work for the year I confess that it is
very difficult for me, out of such a wealth of material, to select the cases which are most interesting in themselves,
and at the same time most conducive to a display of those peculiar powers for which my friend was famous. As I turn over
the pages, I see my notes upon the repulsive story of the red leech and the terrible death of Crosby, the banker. Here
also I find an account of the Addleton tragedy, and the singular contents of the ancient British barrow. The famous
succession case comes also within this period, and so does the tracking and arrest of the Boulevard assassin an exploit
which won for Holmes an autograph letter of thanks from the French President and the Order of the Legion of Honour. Each
of these would furnish a narrative, but on the whole I am of opinion that none of them unites so many singular points of
interest as the episode of Yoxley Old Place, which includes not only the lamentable death of young Willoughby Smith, but
also those subsequent developments which threw so curious a light upon the causes of the crime. It was a wild, night
towards the close of November. Holmes and I sat together in silence all the evening, he engaged with a powerful lens
deciphering the remains of the original inscription upon a palimpsest, I deep in a recent treatise upon surgery. Outside
the wind howled down Baker Street, while the rain beat fiercely against the windows. It was strange there, in the very
depths of the town, with ten miles of man's handiwork on every side of us, to feel the iron grip of Nature, and to be
conscious that to the huge elemental forces all London was no more than the molehills that dot the fields."
